                I like the lip balm, I’ve used it before so I was just replacing my old one. It keeps my lips moisturized in this midwestern winter. Something I really loved along with the product was the box it came in, I loved the picture at the top so pretty.

                I've been trying different lip balms for men and I think this might be my favorite one. It's moisturizing and has this sticky texture that's different from regular lip balms. Less is more for men who don't want their lips to be super shiny. Works great for the winter.
