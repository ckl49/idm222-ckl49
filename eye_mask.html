            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <summary>Can I use Faded Eye Mask with other Topicals products?</summary>
            <details>Absolutely! For stubborn discoloration, we recommend you follow up with Faded Serum.</details>

            <summary>Can Faded Eye Mask treat under eye darkness?</summary>
            <details>If the darkness is caused by skin discoloration and not hollowness, Faded Eye Mask can help reduce the appearance of that discoloration. If the darkness is caused by genetic dark circles, we'd recommend consulting your dermatologist first.</details>

            <summary>How do I store Faded Eye Mask?</summary>
            <details>You can store the unopened packettes under most conditions, but we encourage avoiding extreme heat or cold. For a super cooling, Refreshing and depuffing experience, you can store them in the fridge prior to use.</details>

            <summary>How do I apply Faded Eye Mask?</summary>
            <details>Apply to clean under eye area for 15 minutes. Use 2-3 times a week. For stubborn discoloration, follow up with Faded Serum. For an extra cool treat, refrigerate the patches prior to use.

            TIP: To maximize results. Apply the mask in reverse. Round end near the nose, which is more prone to dark circles and puffiness, or wear the round size towards the temples to address the outer area where dehydration lines can appear.
            </details>

            <summary>Is Faded Eye Mask good for sensitive skin?</summary>
            <details>Topicals products are designed specifically with sensitive skin in mind - that’s why we avoid synthetic fragrances and dyes and use scientifically-proven botanicals and safe synthetics at their optimal concentrations. That said, everyone’s skin is different, so we always recommend reading each product’s ingredient list and patch testing first.</details>

            <summary>Can I use Faded Eye Mask for anything other than under eyes?</summary>
            <details>Yes! You can plump any area of the face that you’d like. </details>

                After being on thyroid meds for 18 months my under eye baggage was hideous. I have been off meds for 12 months. Did some research and decided to try eye patches and topical creams. I thought my bags had popped and I would need surgery. Started using these patches saw results within days. I should’ve started way sooner. I am hoping this is a solution that fixes my problem and not something j have to constantly use. It’s defined saving me thousands of $$$.
