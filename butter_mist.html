                I typically bought this from Sephora but decided to buy directly from Topicals for my last re-up. The new nozzle makes it so hard to apply to more obscure places without wasting a ton of product down the sides of the bottle; the mist is also uneven for these areas. The continuous mist spray version was perfect. I wish there was an option to choose between the type of bottle or the nozzle went back to continuous mist entirely.

                I guess everyone wasn't lying when they said this product smells a little funky. But so far, all is well! I appreciate the clean beauty approach and the incredible don't cause any irritations. It does feel a little bit sticky on the skin, but one could get past that with a moisturizer. I love the fact that the spray makes it easy for the serum to reach wider surface areas. Looking forward to seeing skin improvement with this product.
