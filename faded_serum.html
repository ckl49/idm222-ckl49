                Long standing hyperpigmentation due to years of acne and psoriasis have dramatically faded- I’ve worked up to using the product daily and am halfway through the tube. My skin is the best I’ve ever had since my teen years… even reduced my adult acne to nothing. I started on October 9, 2024 and today is January 19, 2025 (still using the one tube!)

                I'm very impressed with this serum! I've been using it every night after retinol and before moisturizer, and it really has drastically evened out my skin tone. It works!

                It faded my hyperpigmentation on my forehead that was cause by sun damage. I wasn’t even regular on putting every night but it made a difference.

                I used dark spot serum by caudalie and I have to admit that topical was better.

                I purchased the slather and want to see how it improves my KP
