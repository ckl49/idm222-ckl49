                I love this! The color is just perfect and the consistency as well. I’ve purchased two already and going to purchase another!

                Something about this is just not the same as the original slick salve. It’s more sticky and not as moisturizing. I do like the color but overall think they missed the mark with this.

                This lip balm is a very beautiful color, and I love the applicator! Unfortunately, it’s a little bit too sticky for my liking.
