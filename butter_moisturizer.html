            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <summary>Why did we reformulate Like Butter Mask?</summary>
            <details>
                Like Butter has graduated from a hydrating mask to a turbo-charged daily moisturizer with OTC-level 1% colloidal oatmeal to alleviate eczema symptoms, moisturize and soothe dry skin.
                The modified texture is richer and creamier, making it easier to incorporate into your daily skincare regimen. Active ingredients support the skin barrier that helps skin defend itself from environmental irritants.
                
                Like before, Like Butter can be used as a hydrating base for smoother makeup application, as your go-to eczema cream, and now also as your daily moisturizer.
            </details>

            <summary>Why steroid-free?</summary>
            <details>Using steroids to treat eczema over a long period of time can lead to side effects like thinning skin, stretch marks, and increased susceptibility to infections. Break the cycle of dependence today. At Topicals, we’re dedicated to creating skincare that’s safe for long-term — for every skin type, shade, and age.</details>

            <summary>Is it an eczema treatment or a moisturizer?</summary>
            <details>Both! Like Butter is a daily rich moisturizer that doubles as an over the counter eczema treatment. Because it’s steroid-free, it’s safe for daily use as a rich, hydrating moisturizer head-to-toe.</details>

            <summary>So it has oatmeal, what's the big deal?</summary>
            <details>Like Butter is an OTC grade moisturizer that contains 1% colloidal oatmeal which is approved, tested and proven by the FDA to relieve eczema symptoms.</details>

            <summary>Does Like Butter expire?</summary>
            <details>Because Like Butter is an over-the-counter product with 1% colloidal oatmeal, we are required to list an expiration date on the packaging. Using the product after the expiration date will not guarantee results from the active ingredients, however it is perfectly safe to use.</details>

                Super moisturizing but I don’t like the tube very much. It may be important to the ingredients but I haven’t quite figured out how to keep from wasting the moisturizer when closing it.

                A lotion consistency while still being thick and moisturizing like a salve

                I received my package on Saturday. Today is now Wednesday and the significant change I’ve seen on my 2 y.o’s eczema patches is absolutely mind blowing! His patches are much less itchy/dry and are almost not noticeable. Even when the cream is fully absorbed there is still a significant improvement in his patches that used to be dry & dark.
