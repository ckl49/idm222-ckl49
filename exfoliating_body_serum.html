                When I tell you this will transform your skin I mean it! If you have dry, bumpy skin get it! I will never not be without it. Side note I have been told by someone in my life who has diabetic skin that this is what works for them.

                I've had bumps on my arms for years and recently they started developing more on my thighs too so I got this along with another product to try and minimize the bumps. It's only been about a week and I'm already noticing a difference more so than I have with any other product and I've been telling my mom and sister about it now since they have the same issues.

                I’ve been using this body serum almost daily for a few years, and it’s been a game-changer for my keratosis pilaris (KP) and overall skin tone. The milky, moisturizing formula leaves my skin soft and smooth while also helping fade dark marks. One bottle lasts a surprisingly long time!

                The updated packaging is a big improvement. The older design made it easy to accidentally squeeze out too much product, but the current version is much easier to control. That said, I’d still love to see a jumbo size in the future!

                Overall, this serum delivers incredible results and is worth every penny. Highly recommend!

                I use this body serum almost daily and I’ve been repurchasing this product for almost 3 years now. I’ve seen reviews of other people saying that it was hard to dispense the product because a lot comes out at once but I’ve never had that issue. It has that same type of stopper that a squeeze bottle of ketchup does, so it wasn’t that hard (at least for me) to figure out how much pressure to apply for the amount of product that you want to come out . The bottle that I got with this order is slightly different. There’s no stopper in the spout where the product comes out. It’s just open and because of how runny the serum is, if you hold the bottle upside down and you’re not applying any pressure, a lot of product oozes out and there’s no way to stop it other than turning the bottle right side up. PLEASE bring back the old packaging. And also make a jumbo size 🫶🫶🫶🫶

                But other than that I can’t recommend this product enough. It’s amazing. It has a milky texture, is very moisturizing, and it helps a lot with the KP on my chest and legs.
