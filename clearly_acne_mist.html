            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <summary>Is Clearly Mist specifically formulated for body acne, or is it safe to use on the face as well?</summary>
            <details>Clearly Mist is specifically formulated to target acne on both the body and face. It is designed to be gentle yet effective, making it safe for sensitive facial skin while providing targeted care for larger areas prone to body acne, such as the chest and back.</details>

            <summary>Does Clearly Mist help with blackheads as well, or is it specifically for treating acne?</summary>
            <details>Clearly Mist contains Salicylic Acid, a key ingredient known for its ability to penetrate deep into the pores. This exfoliating action not only helps treat active acne but also clears out excess oil and dead skin cells that can lead to blackheads. It's an all-in-one solution for maintaining clearer skin.</details>

            <summary>How soon can I expect to see visible results after using Clearly Mist?</summary>
            <details>The timeline for visible results depends on the severity of your breakouts and consistency of use. Many users report seeing improvements, such as reduced redness and fewer breakouts, within a few days to a week, while more significant changes may take 4+ weeks of regular application.</details>

            <summary>Can I use this with Vitamin C?</summary>
            <details>Yes, Clearly Mist can be incorporated into the same routine as Vitamin C. However, to maximize effectiveness and avoid product interference, apply Clearly Mist (which contains hypochlorous acid) first. Let it dry completely for about 20-30 minutes before applying your Vitamin C serum or antioxidant treatments. This ensures both products perform optimally without deactivating each other.</details>

            <summary>Does the mist feel sticky or greasy after application?</summary>
            <details>No, Clearly Mist has a lightweight, non-sticky, and non-greasy formula. It absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling refreshed and clean, making it suitable for everyday use, even under clothing or other skincare products.</details>

                I absolutely love this facial mist. It feels so nice and refreshing. A lot comes out of the bottle with minimal spritz! I love that it helps with acne without leaving your face red like other acne products. Please please consider buying this if you struggle with acne.

                After being on thyroid meds for 18 months my under eye baggage was hideous. I have been off meds for 12 months. Did some research and decided to try eye patches and topical creams. I thought my bags had popped and I would need surgery. Started using these patches saw results within days. I should’ve started way sooner. I am hoping this is a solution that fixes my problem and not something j have to constantly use. It’s defined saving me thousands of $$$.
