## Mental Health Advocacy

People with chronic skin conditions are 2-6 times more likely to experience anxiety and depression. Why? Because we're taught to aim for perfection when life (and skin) is fluid and messy.

Topicals donates a percentage of our profits to important mental health movements to help raise awareness around the connection between mental health and skin health. To date, we've donated to mental health organizations like Therapy for Black Girls, Fearless Femmes 100, Sad Girls Club, and JED Foundation. When you support Topicals, you support mental health advocacy for  those who need it most. 

## Who Cares? Looks Fade.

Growing up sucked! As someone who always had that skin that didn't look like what I saw in my favorite TV commercials and magazines, I grew up thinking there was such a thing as "perfect" skin & hat I had to have it. Now I know that you make skin look good - not the other way around.
