        <p>Dark Spots From Buttne, Backne or Chestne? </p>
        <p>This fine body mist gently fades the look of your most stubborn marks, scars, and spots so that you can kick back and let your worries fade away. Now in a silkier formula, and a 100% aluminum recyclable bottle.</p>
        <p>We do not recommend using Faded Mist in the same routine with AHAs, BHAs, or retinol. Safe for body hyperpigmentation only to avoid face irritation.</p>

                I purchased this specifically for back, that I can't seem to reach the middle of so it's been dry and itchy. After two uses my back is no longer dry or itching.
