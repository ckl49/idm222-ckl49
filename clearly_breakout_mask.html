                <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
                <summary>Is this clarifying mask suitable for dry, sensitive, or acne-prone skin types?</summary>
                <details>Yes, the mask was specifically developed and tested to ensure it is gentle yet effective for all skin types, including dry, sensitive, and acne-prone skin. Its non-stripping, soothing formula makes it ideal for those with concerns about irritation or over-drying, while still delivering noticeable results for acne-prone individuals.</details>
                <summary>Does this mask help reduce post-acne dark marks or scars?</summary>
                <details>The mask provides some skin-evening benefits but is not designed as a primary treatment for post-acne dark marks or scars. For targeted results, we recommend using Faded Serum to fade dark marks and Sealed to address post-acne scarring. Combining these products with the mask can help create a more comprehensive routine for improving skin texture and tone.</details>
                <summary>Is it safe to use this mask while undergoing acne treatments such as Accutane, Adapalene, tretinoin, BHAs, or AHAs?</summary>
                <details>Yes, but with caution. While the mask is formulated to be gentle, those undergoing active acne treatments may already have heightened skin sensitivity. We recommend consulting your dermatologist before adding this product to your routine. Always perform a patch test on a small area of skin to ensure compatibility, especially if you’re using potent treatments like Accutane or retinoids.</details>
                <summary>Does this mask have a scent? If so, what does it smell like?</summary>
                <details>Clearly Mask is fragrance-free but may have a mild natural scent from Colloidal Sulfur, its key ingredient for controlling bacteria and excess oil. While some detect a slight sulfur-like scent, most find it subtle and unobtrusive.</details>
                <summary>Can I use this mask if I have fungal acne?</summary>
                <details>Yes, the mask is safe for individuals with fungal acne. Its formulation is non-comedogenic and free from ingredients that could exacerbate fungal acne, making it an excellent choice for soothing and clarifying the skin while maintaining a balanced microbiome.</details>

                    This mask is so good! It’s easy to apply and it’s gentle on the skin. It calmed my skin - I actually had a bump that was sore to touch and after using this it wasn’t anymore! It went down a little too. I like that I can use this as a spot treatment or all over the face.

                    I’ve been using the Clearly Breakout Mask for a few weeks now, and I am beyond impressed with the results. This mask is a must-have for anyone struggling with breakouts or uneven skin tone. The formula feels incredibly soothing on the skin, and I love that it’s made with natural, high-quality ingredients. After just a few uses, I noticed a significant reduction in the size of my blemishes. It doesn’t dry out my skin like some other masks do, but instead leaves it feeling hydrated, refreshed, and balanced. One of my favorite things about this product is how quick and easy it is to use. In just 10-15 minutes, my skin feels detoxified and smooth. Plus, it’s gentle enough to use regularly without irritating my sensitive skin.
                    If you’re looking for a reliable, effective solution for breakouts, I can’t recommend the Clearly Breakout Mask enough. It’s worth every penny!

                    I have some acne breakouts on my skin and wanted a mask that I could use as a spot treatment. This mask is easy to apply and actually works if I use it consistently. It works on my sensitive skin too!
