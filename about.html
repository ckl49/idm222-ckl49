    <h1>Welcome to Our World.</h1>

<h2>Meet our Advisory Board</h2>
<p>Dr Teng is a board-certified pediatric dermatologist, and is the Director of Pediatric Dermatology at Stanford University. She ha been in practice for more than 12 years, and has overseen more than 20 dermatology clinical trials. She also co-authored the book Therapy in Pediatric Dermatology-Management of Pediatric Skin Disease, and focuses her research on drug discovery and novel therapy for skin disorders.</p>
<p>Dr. Flynn is a Damon Runyon postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University in the Department of Chemistry. He is opening his own lab in 2021 at Boston Children's Hospital in the Stem Cell Program and the Harvard Department off Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology at Harvard University where he will research how RNA an glycans work together to influence human disease. </p>

<h2>Mental Health Advocacy</h2>
<p>People with chronic skin conditions are 2-6 times more likely to experience anxiety and depression. Why? Because we're taught to aim for perfection when life (and skin) is fluid and messy.</p>
<p>Topicals donates a percentage of our profits to important mental health movements to help raise awareness around the connection between mental health and skin health. To date, we've donated to mental health organizations like Therapy for Black Girls, Fearless Femmes 100, Sad Girls Club, and JED Foundation. When you support Topicals, you support mental health advocacy for  those who need it most. </p>

<h2>Who Cares? Looks Fade.</h2>
<p>Growing up sucked! As someone who always had that skin that didn't look like what I saw in my favorite TV commercials and magazines, I grew up thinking there was such a thing as "perfect" skin & hat I had to have it. Now I know that you make skin look good - not the other way around. </p>
